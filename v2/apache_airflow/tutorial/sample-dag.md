This tutorial walks through some of the [core Apache Airflow concepts](/v2/apache_airflow/tutorial/core-airflow-concepts) and how they fit into a simple, sample Airflow DAG.

### Sample Pipeline Definition
Here is an example of a basic pipeline definition. Below it, you'll find a line by line explanation of the various pipeline components.

~~~ python
from datetime import datetime
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator

args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'start_date': datetime(2017, 9, 10, 0, 0),
    'random_logic': False
}

dag = DAG(
    'sample_dag',
    schedule_interval="@once",
    default_args=args
)

t1 = DummyOperator(
    task_id='extract_data',
    dag=dag
)

t2 = DummyOperator(
    task_id='load_data',
    dag=dag
)

t3 = DummyOperator(
    task_id='random_task',
    dag=dag
)

t1.set_downstream(t2)
t2.set_downstream(t3)
~~~

### Importing Modules
First things first, we need to import all of the necessary modules.

~~~
from datetime import datetime

# DAG Object - we need this to instantiate the DAG
from airflow import DAG

# Operators - these are needed for the DAG to actually operate. We are just using Dummy operators in this example
from airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator
~~~

### Default Arguments
Here, we can define a set of arguments that are then explicitly passed to each subsequent task. Setting default arguments is not mandatory but doing so can reduce redundancy later in the pipeline.

In this example, we use the default args to define the common `owner`, `start_date`, and a line of `random_logic` for all of the tasks.

~~~
args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'start_date': datetime(2017, 9, 10, 0, 0),
    'random_logic': True
}
~~~

### Instantiate the DAG
Before we outline the tasks we want to run, we need a DAG to nest them into. First, we pass a string in for `dag_id` to serve as a unique identifier for the DAG. In this case, we kept it simple and used `sample_dag`.

Next, we define a `schedule_interval` that dictates how often the DAG will run (just `@once` here).

Finally, we passed in the default argument dictionary we defined earlier for our `default_args`.

~~~
dag = DAG(
    'sample_dag',
    schedule_interval="@once",
    default_args=args
}
~~~

### Creating Tasks
Great! Now that we have a DAG, we can start defining tasks that we want to run. As mentioned in the [Core Airflow Concepts doc](/v2/apache_airflow/tutorial/core-airflow-concepts), tasks are generated by instantiating operator objects.

For this sample, we just used dummy operators to create 3 generic tasks - `extract_data`(t1), `load_data`(t2), and `random_task`(t3) - but you can get a lot more creative with your tasks with the wide swath of [operators](/v2/apache_airflow/operators/overview.html) that are available.

~~~
t1 = DummyOperator(
    task_id='extract_data',
    dag=dag
)

t2 = DummyOperator(
    task_id='load_data',
    dag=dag
)

t3 = DummyOperator(
    task_id='random_task',
    dag=dag
)
~~~

### Setting up Dependencies
Since the tasks we created aren't inherently dependent on each other, we can explicitly define the dependencies between them. The way we have defined dependencies in this example pipeline results in the following:

>t3 runs first

>t2 runs after t3 runs successfully

>t1 runs after t2 runs successfully

~~~
t1.set_downstream(t2)
t2.set_downstream(t3)
~~~

We can also use bitshift operators to set dependencies.

~~~
t1 >> t2
t2 >> t3
~~~

With that, we have successfully written an Airflow DAG! Head [here](/v2/apache_airflow/tutorial/dag-deployment) to see how to deploy this DAG.
