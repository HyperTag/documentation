As data gets bigger and faster, many organizations struggle to centralize and prepare unwieldy data sets for analytics.

Apache Airflow is a data workflow management system that allows engineers to schedule, deploy and monitor their own data pipes as DAGs (directed acyclic graphs). Built by developers, for developers, itâ€™s based on the principle that ETL is best expressed in code.

By running Apache Airflow on Astronomer, you get:

* One-click deployment through the [Astro CLI](/v2/apache_airflow/cli.html)
* Access to our [Airflow contributions](https://github.com/airflow-plugins) which includes new hooks and operators
* Serverless Airflow worker scalability through our SaaS platform
* Access to our support documentation and team
* Access to our Airflow development services team
