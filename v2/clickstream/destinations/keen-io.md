#NOT DONE

Astronomer Clickstream makes it easy to send your data to Keen IO. Once you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to Keen IO in the appropriate format. 

## Getting Started with Keen IO and Astronomer Clickstream

To get started sending events to Keen IO, you'll need two things:
* Project ID: This tells Astronomer which project within Keen IO is yours
* Write Key: This gives Astronomer permission to send data to your Keen IO dashboard
Both of these things will be long strings of random characters.

Once you create a Keen IO account, copy over your Project ID and Write Key into the Astronomer dashboard. You can find your Write Key by clicking on 'Show API Keys.'

Your pipeline will be activated once you click 'Create Destination.'

To get started sending events to Keen IO, you'll need a Project ID and Write Key. The ID is what tells Astronomer which project within Keen IO is yours and the Write Key gives Astronomer permission to send data into it. Both will be long strings of random characters (the ID will be 24 characters and the Write Key will be 224.)

<b>Step 1</b> Create a Keen IO account via their [website](http://www.keen.io)

<b>Step 2</b> Keen IO is kind enough to create your first project for you so you already have anything you'll need. They even have a reminder that you haven't sent any data to them yet. We'll fix that soon enough ;) For now, copy over your Project ID and Write Key (which you can get by clicking on 'Show API Keys')

<b>Step 3</b> Add your Project ID and Write Key into the Keen IO integration on your Astronomer dashboard and give your new connection a unique name. Click 'Create Destination' and your pipeline will be activated.

<b>Step 4</b> Click around your app to send off some test events and then go back to Keen IO to see those events begin populating your project! They should appear in less than a minute!
