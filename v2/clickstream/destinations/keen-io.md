Astronomer Clickstream makes it easy to send your data to Keen IO. Once you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to Keen IO in the appropriate format. 

## Getting Started with Keen IO and Astronomer Clickstream

To get started sending events to Keen IO, you'll need two things:
* Project ID: This tells Astronomer which project within Keen IO is yours
* Write Key: This gives Astronomer permission to send data to your Keen IO dashboard
Both of these things will be long strings of random characters.

Once you create a Keen IO account, copy over your Project ID and Write Key into the Astronomer dashboard. You can find your Write Key by clicking on 'Show API Keys.'

Your pipeline will be activated once you click 'Create Destination.'
