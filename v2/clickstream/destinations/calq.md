#NOT DONE
To get started sending events to Calq, you're only going to need your Write Key.

**Step 1:** Create a Calq account via their [website](http://www.calq.io). After you create your account, you'll be asked to create a new project.

**Step 2:** Calq makes it really easy to send data to them. As soon as you create your new project, you'll be advised to integrate their client library. In that section, you'll find your write key, which is all you need when using Astronomer.

<b>Step 3 -</b> Add your App ID into the Calq integration on your Astronomer dashboard and give your new connection a unique name. Click 'Create Destination' and your pipeline will be activated.

<b>Step 4 -</b> If you look back at your Calq account, you'll have already sent your first events and will have a message waiting for you at the bottom of the page you were on confirming that the events have been received. If you don't see a confirmation message like below, something's gone wrong.

And...yep! Those are our events!
