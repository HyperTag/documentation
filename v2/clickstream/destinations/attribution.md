Astronomer Clickstream makes it easy to send your data to Attribution. Once you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to Bing Ads in the appropriate format.

## What is Attribution?

Attribution's platform uses multi-touch attribution models to spread spending credit across ad platforms, social channels, and content marketing. This allows your team to effectively track performance across platforms and allot your advertising budget accordingly. 

Attribution gives you insight to your true ROI by pulling your cost data from ad platforms, correlating the cost to specific users, then tracking revenue from those users over time. Once you define your lifetime value, Attribution lets you track both the revenue collected as it happens as well as the revenue expected based on the account. Their people-over-devices model can give your team a better understanding of the customer journey.

## Why integrate Attribution with Astronomer Clickstream and how does it work?

If you installed Attribution on its own, you'd have to carefully map the data you're looking for and run the implementation on your product, which would require some custom code for each page and event you want to track. 

With Clickstream, Astronomer takes care of that implementation for you. Astronomer collects all the information Attribution needs from web applications and server-side implementations. So, once you give us your Attribution `Project ID` and we set up that pipeline, you're set.

In short, Astronomer Clickstream gives you the benefits of Attribution's platform without the headache of manually implementing the integration. 

## Getting Started with Attribution & Astronomer Clickstream

### Attribution Side

All you'll need from Attribution once you have an account is your `Project ID`, which you can find at the top-right of your integration settings page. Check out the image below:

With that 8-character ID, go right ahead to your Astronomer dashboard to finish setting up the pipeline.

### Astronomer Side

Once you're on our UI, add Attribution as a destination on your client-side or server-side source. From there, give your connection a unique name and enter your `Project ID` where prompted. 

Finally, click `Create Destination` to activate your pipeline.

And that's it! You're ready for insights.
