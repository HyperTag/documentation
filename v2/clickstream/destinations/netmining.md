Astronomer Clickstream makes it easy to send your data to Netmining. Once you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to Netmining in the appropriate format.

## What is Netmining and how does it work?

Netmining is an audience targeting platform that allows you to uncover audience data for your online marketing campaigns. It identifies and targets your audience through their behavior, including where they are, what device they're using, and their specific actions on your site or app. Netmining then combines this information with their data capabilities for retargeting purposes.

## Getting Started with Netmining and Astronomer Clickstream

### Netmining Side

Once you create your Netmining account, you'll need to work with your Account Manager on their side to get your AID code. Once you have this code, copy it to your clipboard.

### Astronomer Side

Paste your AID code into the appropriate field in your Astronomer UI. You can then activate your pipeline to begin dumping your clickstream data into Netmining.
