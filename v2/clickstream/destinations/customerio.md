## Getting Started with Acquisio and Astronomer Clickstream

To get started sending events to Customer.io, you're going to need your Site ID and your API Key.

Once you create a [Customer.io](customer.io) account, you'll be asked to create an organization.

You will find both your Site ID and API Key clearly presented and labeled once you click on the 'Integration' tab within the 'Configuration' section of the left hand menu.

Add your App ID into the Customer.io connector on your Astronomer dashboard and give your new connection a unique name. Click 'Create Destination' and your pipeline will be activated.
