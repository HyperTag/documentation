To get started sending events to Customer.io, you're going to need both your Site ID and your API Key, both of which are 20 random characters and quite easy to find.

<b>Step 1 -</b> Create a Customer.io account via their [website](http://www.customer.io). After you create your account, you'll be asked to create an organization.

<b>Step 2 -</b> You can find both your Site ID and API Key clearly presented and labeled (thanks Customer.io for making it easy!) once you click on the 'Integration' tab within the 'Configuration' section of the left hand menu.

<b>Step 3 -</b> Add your App ID into the Customer.io connector on your Astronomer dashboard and give your new connection a unique name. Click 'Create Destination' and your pipeline will be activated.

<b>Step 4 -</b> Now just go back to your Customer.io account, click into our new app, and look! Events are already populating! You can click around to the 'Activity' tab on the lefthand menu to see what events are occurring.
