Astronomer Clickstream makes it easy to send your data to *Woopra*. Once you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to *Woopra* in the appropriate format. 

## Getting Started with Woopra and Astronomer Clickstream

### Woopra-Side
Once you create your account on the woopra [website](https://www.woopra.com/) , add a new project with the domain of your website or app.

### Astronomer-Side

Add your domain name into the Woopra connector on your Astronomer dashboard and give your new connection a unique name. 

Click `Create Destination` and your pipeline will be activated.

### The Pipeline.

You'll now see your events trickling in on your Woopra account. If you click on the `People` icon on the left hand side of the dashboard, you'll see 1 new user. That's you!

Click on that new user to see the history of events being recorded.
