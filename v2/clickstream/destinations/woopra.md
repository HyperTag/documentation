Create a Woopra account via their [website](http://www.woopra.com).

### Step 2:
After you create your account, you'll be asked to create a new project with the domain of your website or app.

### Step 3:
Add your domain name into the Woopra connector on your Astronomer dashboard and give your new connection a unique name. Click 'Create Destination' and your pipeline will be activated.

### Step 4:
If you look back at your Woopra account, your events should begin to be trickling in. If you click on the 'People' icon on the left hand side of the dashboard, you'll see 1 new user. That's you! Click on that new user to see the history of events being recorded.
