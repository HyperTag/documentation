Astronomer Clickstream makes it easy to send your data to Amplitude. Once you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to Amplitude in the appropriate format. 

## Getting Started with Amplitude and Astronomer Clickstream

To get started sending events to Amplitude, all you need is your API Key. After signing up for an Amplitude account, a page will load asking you to create an organization.

You will then be prompted to create your first app. This app will function as your project to recieve events from Astronomer.

After this app is created, an API Key will be generated and presented in your dashboard.

Add this API Key to the Amplitude connector on the Astronomer dashboard and give your new connection a unique name. Your pipeline will be activated once you click 'Create Destination.'

You can now go back into your amplitude account and see your user activity! To see exactly what events are being sent over, you can click around the 'Events' and 'User Activity' tabs.
