#NOT DONE

Using Amplitude with Astronomer is simple. Follow the instructions below to get your data flowing to Amplitude.

## Getting Started with Amplitude and Astronomer Clickstream

To get started sending events to Amplitude, all you need is your API Key. Once you create your first app within your Amplitude account, an API Key will be generated and presented in your dashboard. Add this API Key to the Amplitude connector on the Astronomer dashboard and give your new connection a unique name. Your pipeline will be activated once you click 'Create Destination.'
