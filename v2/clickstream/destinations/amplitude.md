#NOT DONE
To get started sending events to Amplitude, all you'll need is your API Key, which can be found as soon as you create an account with them.

### Step 1:
Create an Amplitude account via their [website](http://www.amplitude.com). After you create your account, you'll be asked to create an organization.

### Step 2:
A page will load asking you to create your first app. Within Amplitude, this will function as your project to receive events from Astronomer.

As soon as you create your first app, an API Key will be generated and presented into this dashboard.

### Step 3
Add your App ID into the Amplitude connector on your Astronomer dashboard and give your new connection a unique name. Click 'Create Destination' and your pipeline will be activated.

### Step 4:
Now just go back to your amplitude account, click into our new app, and look! We've got exactly one active user! You can click around to the 'Events' and 'User Activity' tabs at the top to see exactly what you've been doing and what events are being sent over.
