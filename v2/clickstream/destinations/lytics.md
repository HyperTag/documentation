#NOT DONE
To get started sending events to Lytics, you're only going to need your Data API Key and Account ID.

<b>Step 1</b> Create a Lytics account via their [website](http://www.getlytics.com).

<b>Step 2</b>After you create your account, you'll be dropped into a welcome page asking you connect up some integrations.

We're not on that page yet (if you work at Lytics, we'd love to join the ranks!) but here's how you connect us up. Click on your email address at the top right, and click on the 'Manage Accounts' option. There you'll see your ID on the left hand side of your account and your Data API on the right.

<b>Step 3</b> Add your Account ID and Data API into the Lytics connector on your Astronomer dashboard and give your new connection a unique name. Click 'Create Destination' and your pipeline will be activated.

<b>Step 4</b>  Lytics updates their incoming data stream every two minutes so your events won't show up QUITE immediately, but give it a couple of minutes. You can check back in on the status of your project by going to the 'Data' tab at the top.
