## Overview

Astronomer has a robust library of destinations consisting of data warehouses, A/B testing tools, analytics tools, marketing tools, and more. These destinations receive data from the sources that you select in your Astronomer UI. 

For specific information on each destination and what it is used for, check out the specific docs in the sidebar. If you would like to request that your tool be integrated with Astronomer, feel free to shoot us an email at humans@astronomer.io.
