To get started using the DoubleClick Floodlight, you'll need to identify your Advertiser ID. Because DoubleClick is a rather expensive platform, you might be going through a DoubleClick Partner, such as [Mightyhive](http://mightyhive.com), in which case you'll want to get your Advertiser ID from them.

<b>Step 1 -</b> Put your seven character Advertiser ID in the "Advertiser ID" section of the Overview tab. Below that, you'll also want to put your Activity Group label (referred to as "type" within Doubleclick) as well as your Activity Tag String Value (referred to as "cat") for tracking page views.

<b>Step 2 -</b> If you want to pass in specific track events to Doubleclick, you can do so within the Events section in the Advanced tab. Simply specify the name of the event exactly as it is sent to Astronomer and the corresponding Type and CAT values for the Activity Group in DoubleClick.

<b>Step 3 -</b> Custom properties can be added to the events sent to Doubleclick by specifying the specific property and mapping to the corresponding property label in Doubleclick (e.g. u1, u2, etc.)
