Astronomer Clickstream makes it easy to send your data to webhooks. Once you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to webhooks in the appropriate format.

## What are webhooks and how do they work?

A webhook, is a custom user-defined callback function fired on the server side in response to an HTTP POST request.

They are used to provide custom actions in reaction to event notification, for example, posting a message to a Slack channel every time a user completes a custom "Sign Up" track event in your app. It's an efficient way to provide realtime updates.

A webhook submits realtime user data, ties customer information to a dedicate API, records mobile and e-commerce data, and maps events to custom features within FB ads and Google Analytics.

Get instant, realtime notifications without having to manually poll your data.
