Astronomer Clickstream makes it easy to send your data to webhooks. Once you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to webhooks in the appropriate format.

## What are webhooks and how do they work?

A Webhook (also called a web callback or an HTTP push API) is a simple event-notification via HTTP POST. It's a way for an application to provide others with real-time information, making it extremely efficient for both the provider and consumer.

A Webhook submits real-time user data, ties customer information to a dedicate API, records mobile and e-commerce data, and maps events to custom features within FB ads and Google Analytics.

Get instant, real-time notifications without having to manually poll your data.
