Astronomer Clickstream makes it easy to send your data to webhooks from server-side, mobile, *and* client-side. Once you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to webhooks in the appropriate format.

## What are webhooks and how do they work?

A webhook is a custom, user-defined callback function fired in response to an HTTP POST request. It's a useful tool for apps that want to execute code in response to an event occurrence. For example, you might want to post a message to a Slack channel every time a user completes a custom "Sign Up" track event in your app. 

It's an efficient way to provide realtime updates.

A webhook submits realtime user data, ties customer information to a dedicate API, records mobile and e-commerce data, and maps events to custom features within FB ads and Google Analytics.

Get instant, realtime notifications without having to manually poll your data.
