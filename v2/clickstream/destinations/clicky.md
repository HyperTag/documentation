#NOT DONE
To get started sending events to Clicky, you'll need to your Site ID, which is a 9 character string that uniquely identifies your site with Clicky.  To get up and running you'll need to:

<b>Step 1 -</b> Create a Clicky account via their [website](http://www.clicky.com). Just look for the giant red button with the words 'Register Now.' You really can't miss it ;)

You'll be asked to complete a few basic fields such as email, password, url to track, etc. You can register any website you want.

BUT (and there's always a but) you won't be able to get statistics for that website unless you have the ability to instrument the site and drop in your unique site id (which we'll get to in a minute.)

<b>Step 2 -</b> After you create your account, you'll land on a page to configure a few basic settings. Feel free to adjust anything relevant (Time zone is a useful one) and then click 'Save.' Alternatively, you can go ahead and skip this section and then click the blue 'Preferences' button on the right side of the main menu bar.

<b>Step 3 -</b> The preferences button is going to bring you a page with all of your site information. Your site id will be at the top of the list.

<b>Step 4 -</b> Just put in your Site ID and give your new connection a unique name. Click 'Create Destination' and your pipeline will be activated.
