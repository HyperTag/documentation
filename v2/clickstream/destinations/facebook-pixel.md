**Step 1-** To get started using the Facebook Pixel, you will first need to create a Facebook for Business account and [follow the instructions](https://www.facebook.com/business/a/online-sales/custom-audiences-website) for creating a Pixel. You'll only create one pixel for your site (typically labeled with the name of your business). This pixel will [replace all the functionality](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1686199411616919) previously given to Facebook Audiences and Facebook Conversions (as well as allowing some additional features, such as custom conversions.)

<b>Step 2 -</b> Identify your unique Facebook Pixel ID, which will be a 15 digit number that uniquely identifies both your site. Put your Facebook Pixel ID into your Astronomer account and give your new connection a unique name.

Click 'Create Destination' and your pipeline will be activated.

<b>Step 3 -</b>Facebook has nine [Standard Events](https://www.facebook.com/business/a/add-pixel-standard-events) which are predefined within the Facebook for Business platform. To connect your events to these predefined ones within Facebook, just input the name of the Astronomer event and choose the appropriate Standard Facebook Event that corresponds to it.

<b>Step 4 -</b> If you are using the Facebook Pixel integration as a replacement for Conversion Pixels as well, put each Conversion Pixel ID into your Astronomer account next to the corresponding event in Astronomer that you've already set up. Make sure you include all capitals letters and spaces used in your event labels.
