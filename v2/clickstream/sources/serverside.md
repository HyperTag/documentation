## Getting Started with Server-Side Sources

Server-side ingestion allows you to send data to Astronomer directly from your servers. These sources should be used only when standard analytics.js will not work. Use cases will include payment events, data sets where accuracy is extremely important, data that needs to be calculated from a database query, or sensitive information.

We support a number of open source libraries, including:

* [HTTP API](../sources/httpapi.html)
* [Java](../sources/java.html)
* [MeteorJS](../sources/meteorjs.html)
* [Node.js](../sources/nodejs.html)
* [.NET](../sources/net.html)
* [PHP](../sources/php.html)
* [Python](../sources/python.html)
* [Ruby](../sources/ruby.html)
