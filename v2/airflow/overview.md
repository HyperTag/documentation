As data gets bigger and faster, many organizations struggle to centralize and prepare unwieldy data sets for analytics. Data scientists and data engineers have turned to drag-and-drop ETL tools or expensive point-and-click solutions, which are challenging to scale and result in clunky workarounds and recurring bottlenecks.

Apache Airflow is a data work ow management system that allows engineers to schedule, deploy and monitor their own data pipes as DAGs (directed acyclic graphs). Built by devs, for devs, itâ€™s based on the principle that ETL is best expressed in code (which is even better when open sourced).

By running Apache Airflow on Astronomer, you get:

* One-click deployment through the [Astro CLI]((https://docs.astronomer.io/v2/airflow/cli.html))
* Access to our [Airflow contributions](https://github.com/astronomerio/example-pipelines) which includes new hooks and operators
* Serverless Airflow worker scalability through our SaaS platform
* Access to our support documentation and team
* Access to our Airflow development services team
