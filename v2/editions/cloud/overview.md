MetaRouter Cloud Edition is our SaaS offering. This is different from our [Enterprise](../enterprise/overview.html) edition in that we run the infrastructure in our cloud rather than deploying to your private cloud or running in a docker container on your local machine.

Astronomer Cloud is where many of our customers start their journey with streaming data, while Enterprise is typically used by larger companies that have outgrown SaaS and would like to keep all of their data in their own environment. To get started setting up, sign up for MetaRouter Cloud [here](https://app.metarouter.io/signup).

Psst. Check out the [Sources](../../clickstream/sources/overview.html) and [Destinations](../../clickstream/destinations/overview.html) supported by our Cloud product.
