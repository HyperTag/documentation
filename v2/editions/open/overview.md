## Overview

Astronomer [Open Edition](http://open.astronomer.io/)
allows you to run Astronomer on your own
machine in order to support the dev experience, but it can also be
used to under Apache 2 license for any purpose supported by that
license.

We distribute official Dockerfiles that build and install tagged
releases of the services composing the Astronomer Platform on
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/astronomerinc/).
