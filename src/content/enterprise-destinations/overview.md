MetaRouter has a robust library of destinations consisting of data warehouses, A/B testing tools, analytics tools, marketing tools, and more. These destinations receive data from the sources that you select in your MetaRouter UI.

Check out our source/destination compatibility matrix below to see which destinations can accept the data that you'd like to send:
