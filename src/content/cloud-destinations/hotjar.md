# Hotjar

MetaRouter makes it easy to send your data to Hotjar. Once you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to Hotjar in the appropriate format.

## What is Hotjar and how does it work?

Hotjar is a web and mobile behavioral analytics product that creates heatmaps that turns user clicks into a heatmap of your website or mobile app. It provides responsive surveys to help collect customer insights after key events like conversion or cart abandonment, and enables user testing so that marketers can create custom messages based on specific events.

In order to use Hotjar, you need to manually install its tracking code directly into your site.

## Why send data to Hotjar using MetaRouter?

MetaRouter will automatically load the Hotjar script once you've enabled the integration in your UI. We eliminate the need for any developer work so that you can get straight to analyzing how users interact with your site using Hotjar.

## Getting Started with Hotjar and MetaRouter

Hotjar automatically tracks visits and bound page events that you've defined in your Hotjar account. When MetaRouter loads the Hotjar snippet, the triggers that you've defined in your Hotjar profile are automatically placed on your website and will function normally.

All you need to do to start using Hotjar with MetaRouter is input your `Hotjar Snippet Version` and your `Hotjar ID` in the MetaRouter UI. Both of these items can be found within your Hotjar account.
