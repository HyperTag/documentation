Astronomer Cloud Edition is our SaaS offering. This is different from our [Enterprise](../enterprise/overview.html) and [Open](../open/overview.html) editions in that we run the infrastructure in our cloud rather than deploying to your VPC or running in a docker container on your local machine. It is therefore priced and billed differently than our Enterprise Edition is.
